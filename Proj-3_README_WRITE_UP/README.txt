# OS Scheduler

## Introduction

A simple demonstration of different types of schedulers in modern days Operating Systems.

## How to run

Run the [OS](./src/driver/OS.java) 

Requirements of the program:

1. Driver files (OS.java and Job.java) must be in the [driver] folder.
2. Scheduler files (Scheduler.java, FCFS.java, RR.java, SPN.java, SRT.java, Preemptive.java, and NonPreemptive.java) must be in same [schedulers] folder. 
3. Compile with OS.java as main class
4. Program takes 2 arguments from command line [example.sf] and [example.pf]

## Note: 

I used Netbeans IDE to write and run but will work after compiling java classes in command prompt and including 2 args.
